Machine Learning Algorithms: Random Forest
This repository contains an implementation of the  Random Forest algorithm as part of my machine learning studies. It includes simple  Random Forest model, along with code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The project serves as a foundational step in understanding and applying supervised learning techniques.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute!
